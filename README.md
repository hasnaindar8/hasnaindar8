### 👋 Hi, I'm **Hasnain**

I'm a Software Engineer with a Master’s in Computer Science and over two years of experience as a Java Developer, building secure and scalable backend systems using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. I’m currently expanding into full-stack development through Northcoders, where I’m working with **JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express.js**.

I enjoy solving complex problems, designing maintainable systems, and writing clean, test-driven code. I’m always learning, exploring new tools, and building projects that deliver real value.
